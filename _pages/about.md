# Welcome!

I am a PhD Student in Economics at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. My thesis advisors are Edouard Challe and Russell Cooper. I am also a research fellow at the Department of Economics and Finance of LUISS in Rome.

During my PhD studies, I visited New York University, the Bank for International Settlements and the European Central Bank.

My research interests are in quantitative macroeconomics, household finance, and behavioural macro. I study the aggregate implications of heterogeneity in households' consumption-savings behaviour using both standard and behavioural theories. In my job market paper, I analyse how income inequality shapes householdsâ€™ demand for different assets in the economy and, ultimately, the composition of firms. 

**I will be on the 2024-2025 academic Job Market.**
