# Welcome!

I am a PhD Student in Economics at the European University Institute under the supervision of Edouard Challe and Russell Cooper.

My research interests are in international macro-finance, household finance and behavioural macro. I study the aggregate implications of heterogeneity in households' consumption-savings behaviour using both standard and behavioural theories.
