# Welcome!

I am a PhD Student in Economics at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. My thesis advisors are Edouard Challe and Russell Cooper. I am also a research fellow at the Department of Economics and Finance of LUISS in Rome.

My research interests are in macro-finance, household finance and behavioural macro. I study the aggregate implications of heterogeneity in households' consumption-savings behaviour using both standard and behavioural theories.

**I will be on the 2024-2025 academic Job Market.**
