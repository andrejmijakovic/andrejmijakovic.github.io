# Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Mannheim. I received a PhD in Economics from the European University Institute in Florence in 2025.

My research interests are in quantitative macroeconomics, household finance, and behavioural macroeconomics. I study the aggregate implications of heterogeneity in households' consumption- and savings behaviour using both standard and behavioural theories.
