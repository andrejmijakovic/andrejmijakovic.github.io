## Job Market Paper
- [**Income Inequality and the Rise of Risky Capital**](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io/research/jmp.pdf)<br/>
   <p style="font-size: 16px"> I study how income inequality shapes households’ demand for different assets in the economy and, ultimately, the composition of firms. Because higher-income households hold riskier asset portfolios, the distribution of income affects the allocation of resources across households with different risk-bearing capacities. Using a quantitative heterogeneous agent model, I show that the sharp  rise in income inequality in the United States since the 1980s tilted household portfolios towards riskier assets and shifted the firm distribution towards riskier but more productive firms. This reallocation of capital raised overall productivity and benefitted low-income households through higher wage rates. The model can account for several macro-finance trends, including the secular decrease in the risk-free rate and the stable average return to capital through a capital composition effect. </p>

## Working papers
- [**Marginal Propensities to Consume with Mental Accounting**](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io/assets/draft_mpc_apr24.pdf) [April 24] <br/>
    [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4603292) <br/>
   <p style="font-size: 16px"> The empirical literature studying marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) has identified a set of puzzles that are difficult to reconcile with traditional theories of consumption behaviour. This paper proposes a model of dissaving-averse households, a behavioural feature consistent with mental accounting, that addresses several of these puzzles jointly. The model generates high MPCs out of income gains, low MPCs out of income news, low MPCs out of wealth and asymmetric MPCs, i.e. stronger consumption responses to income losses than to income gains, for highliquidity households. In support of this prediction, I provide empirical evidence for the existence of pervasive MPC asymmetries. I show through the lens of a quantitative life-cycle model with mental accounting preferences that asymmetric MPCs dampen the effectiveness of redistributive fiscal policy. </p>

     <p style="font-size: 16px"> In the U.S., over 25% of households are coholders who simultaneously borrow on credit cards and hold cash. This generates rich marginal distributions of gross positions that underpin the distribution of net wealth often used to calibrate macroeconomic models. We show that, beyond constructing net wealth, gross positions of liquid assets and debt are important determinants of how households consume, save, and repay debt in response to income shocks. We build a model that generates aggregate distributions and household behavior in line with the data, and use it to study the implications of coholding for fiscal and monetary policy.</p>

- [**Domestic Inequality and Global Imbalances**](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io/assets/mazza_mijakovic_inequality_imbalances_aug24.pdf), with [*Jan Mazza*](https://www.janmazza.com/) [August 24] <br/>
   <p style="font-size: 16px"> We study how the within-country distribution of income affects the current account. We document that higher income inequality is associated with higher current account balances, especially in advanced economies. This relation is driven by inequality in the permanent rather than the transitory component of income, and domestic savings rather than investment. We rationalize the empirical findings through a two-country heterogeneous agent model with non-homothetic preferences. The model generates increasing demand for savings across the distribution of permanent income, which, under international capital mobility, results in capital flows from unequal to equal countries. We use the model to analyze the effects of redistribution, financial liberalisation and cross-border financial integration. </p>

- [**Central Bank Communication and Media Coverage**](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io/assets/draft_cb_media_oct24.pdf), with [*Fiorella De Fiore*](https://www.bis.org/author/fiorella_de_fiore.htm), *Alexis Maurin* and [*Damiano Sandri*](https://sites.google.com/site/damianosandri) [October 24] <br/>
   <p style="font-size: 16px"> We analyse the role played by the media in channelling information about the monetary policy stance of the Federal Reserve to the public. We use large language models to assess the consistency between FOMC communication and media coverage over the period 1994-2023. We find a tight correspondence between the two but also detect considerable changes over time. The pass-through of FOMC communication to the media weakened considerably when interest rates reached the zero-lower bound after the global financial crisis and then improved with the introduction of post-FOMC press conferences, which now exert a particularly strong influence on the media. We also document a weaker communication pass-through at the beginning of a new Fed chair’s tenure. Finally, we show that the media coverage influences households’ inflation expectations, while we do not detect any association with the sentiment directly expressed in FOMC communication. </p>

   <p style="font-size: 16px"> In this paper we evaluate the predictive power of the three most popular equilibrium exchange rate concepts: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) and the Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach. We show that there is a clear trade-off between storytelling and forecast accuracy. The PPP model offers little economic insight, but has good predictive power. The BEER framework, which links exchange rates to fundamentals, does not deliver forecasts of better quality than PPP. The MB approach has the richest economic interpretation, but performs poorly in forecasting terms. Sensitivity analysis confirms that changing the composition of fundamentals in the BEER model or modifying key underlying assumptions in the MB model does not generally enhance their predictive power.</p>
