## Job Market Paper
- [**Income Inequality and the Rise of Risky Capital**](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io/research/jmp.pdf)<br/>
   <p style="font-size: 16px"> This paper shows that the rise in labour income inequality since the 1980s can jointly explain four prominent macro-finance trends: the rise in the wealth-to-income ratio and the share of risky assets in household portfolios, the decline in the risk-free interest rate, and the stability of the return to capital. I develop an incomplete markets model with endogenous portfolio choice that captures two salient dimensions of cross-sectional household savings heterogeneity: wealth-to-income ratios and risky asset shares are increasing in labor income. I show that higher income inequality raises asset demand, in particular for risky assets, and reallocates capital towards more productive firms, raising aggregate productivity. Whereas both the risk-free and the risky return decrease in response to higher income inequality, the weighted average return remains stable due to portfolio reallocation towards risky capital. The model predictions are validated by cross-country evidence showing that higher income inequality is associated with a larger share of risky assets and lower risk premia. </p>

## Working papers
- [**Marginal Propensities to Consume with Mental Accounting**](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io/assets/draft_mpc_apr24.pdf) [April 24] <br/>
    [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4603292) <br/>
   <p style="font-size: 16px"> The empirical literature studying marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) has identified a set of puzzles that are difficult to reconcile with traditional theories of consumption behaviour. This paper proposes a model of dissaving-averse households, a behavioural feature consistent with mental accounting, that addresses several of these puzzles jointly. The model generates high MPCs out of income gains, low MPCs out of income news, low MPCs out of wealth and asymmetric MPCs, i.e. stronger consumption responses to income losses than to income gains, for highliquidity households. In support of this prediction, I provide empirical evidence for the existence of pervasive MPC asymmetries. I show through the lens of a quantitative life-cycle model with mental accounting preferences that asymmetric MPCs dampen the effectiveness of redistributive fiscal policy. </p>

     <p style="font-size: 16px"> In the U.S., over 25% of households are coholders who simultaneously borrow on credit cards and hold cash. This generates rich marginal distributions of gross positions that underpin the distribution of net wealth often used to calibrate macroeconomic models. We show that, beyond constructing net wealth, gross positions of liquid assets and debt are important determinants of how households consume, save, and repay debt in response to income shocks. We build a model that generates aggregate distributions and household behavior in line with the data, and use it to study the implications of coholding for fiscal and monetary policy.</p>

   <p style="font-size: 16px"> We study how the within-country distribution of income affects the current account. We document that higher income inequality is associated with higher current account balances, especially in advanced economies. This relation is driven by inequality in the permanent rather than the transitory component of income, and domestic savings rather than investment. We rationalize the empirical findings through a two-country heterogeneous agent model with non-homothetic preferences. The model generates increasing demand for savings across the distribution of permanent income, which, under international capital mobility, results in capital flows from unequal to equal countries. We use the model to analyze the effects of redistribution, financial liberalisation and cross-border financial integration. </p>

- [**Monetary policy in the news: communication pass-through and inflation expectations**](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io/assets/draft_cb_media_dec24.pdf), with [*Fiorella De Fiore*](https://www.bis.org/author/fiorella_de_fiore.htm), *Alexis Maurin* and [*Damiano Sandri*](https://sites.google.com/site/damianosandri) [December 24] <br/>

   <p style="font-size: 16px"> We analyse the media’s role in channelling information about the Fed’s monetary policy stance to the public. Using LLMs, we find a tight correspondence between FOMC communication and media coverage, although with significant variation over time. The communication pass-through weakened during the ZLB period and improved with the introduction of press conferences, which now exert strong influence on the media. Media coverage effects households’ inflation expectations, particularly when inflation is high and volatile, while we do not detect a direct impact of FOMC communication. This underscores the media’s crucial function in channelling central banks’ communication to the public. </p>

   <p style="font-size: 16px"> In this paper we evaluate the predictive power of the three most popular equilibrium exchange rate concepts: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) and the Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach. We show that there is a clear trade-off between storytelling and forecast accuracy. The PPP model offers little economic insight, but has good predictive power. The BEER framework, which links exchange rates to fundamentals, does not deliver forecasts of better quality than PPP. The MB approach has the richest economic interpretation, but performs poorly in forecasting terms. Sensitivity analysis confirms that changing the composition of fundamentals in the BEER model or modifying key underlying assumptions in the MB model does not generally enhance their predictive power.</p>
