## Working papers
- [**Marginal Propensities to Consume with Behavioural Agents**](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io/assets/draft_mpc_oct23.pdf) [Oct 23] <br/>
    [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4603292) <br/>
    <font size="2"> The empirical literature studying marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) has identified a set of puzzles that are difficult to reconcile with traditional theories of consumption behaviour. This paper proposes a model of dissaving-averse households, a behavioural feature consistent with mental accounting, that addresses several of these puzzles jointly. The model generates high MPCs out of income gains, low MPCs out of income news, low MPCs out of wealth and asymmetric MPCs, i.e. stronger consumption responses to income losses than to income gains, for highliquidity households. In support of this prediction, I provide empirical evidence for the existence of pervasive MPC asymmetries. I show through the lens of a quantitative life-cycle model with mental accounting preferences that asymmetric MPCs dampen the effectiveness of redistributive fiscal policy.<font>

- [**The Macroeconomic Implications of Coholding**](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io/assets/draft_mprd_feb24.pdf), with [*M. Boutros*](https://michaelboutros.com/) [Feb 24] <br/>
    <font size="2"> In the United States, 30% of households are coholders who simultaneously borrow on credit cards and hold liquid assets. This generates a rich distribution of gross wealth positions that underpins the distribution of net wealth often used to calibrate macroeconomic models. We show that gross positions are important beyond net wealth in determining how households consume, save, and repay debt in response to positive income shocks. We build a quantitative model which generates the coholding observed in the data and matches the empirically observed marginal propensities to consume, save, and repay debt. The model highlights that fiscal transfers are more effective in stimulating demand if targeted at low gross instead of low net wealth households, while debt relief is overall less effective in the short-run but achieves large consumption gains in the long-run.<font>

## Work in progress
- **Domestic Inequality and Global Imbalances**, with [*J. Mazza*](https://www.janmazza.com/) [Draft available upon request] <br/>
    <font size="2"> We document that higher income inequality is associated with higher current account balances for a large set of countries. A 1 percentage point increase in the share of income earned by the top 1 percent is associated with a 0.4-0.8 percentage point higher current account balance. This relation is driven by differences in saving rates but not investment. We rationalize this finding through a two-country heterogeneous agent model and show that, all else equal, capital flows from unequal to equal countries. Non-homotheticities in preferences generate higher saving rates by rich households which translate into current account surpluses under international capital mobility. The model also incorporates an explicit role for financial markets. We illustrate how financial forces can offset the effects of inequality and induce current account deficits in unequal countries such as the United States.<font>

    <font size="2">In this paper we evaluate the predictive power of the three most popular equilibrium exchange rate concepts: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) and the Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach. We show that there is a clear trade-off between storytelling and forecast accuracy. The PPP model offers little economic insight, but has good predictive power. The BEER framework, which links exchange rates to fundamentals, does not deliver forecasts of better quality than PPP. The MB approach has the richest economic interpretation, but performs poorly in forecasting terms. Sensitivity analysis confirms that changing the composition of fundamentals in the BEER model or modifying key underlying assumptions in the MB model does not generally enhance their predictive power.<font>
